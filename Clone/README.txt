Itsycal is a tiny calendar for your Mac's menu bar.

This version is modified to open Sunrise, instead of the default Calendar (you need to have Sunrise installed for this to work).

If you want, it will display your calendar events as a
companion to the Mac Calendar app. You can also create
and delete (but not edit) events.
